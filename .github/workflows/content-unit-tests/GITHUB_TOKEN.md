Ques: github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
where is this found in my github repo ?

Ans:
The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is **automatically generated by GitHub Actions** for each workflow run. It **doesn't need to be manually created** or added by you.

---

### 🔐 Where does it come from?

GitHub automatically injects a temporary token into the workflow's `secrets` context under the name:

```yaml
secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN
```

This token is:

* **Scoped only to the current repository**
* **Valid only during the workflow run**
* Has limited **permissions** (customizable via `permissions` block in your workflow)

---

### ✅ Where can you find or manage it?

Although you **don’t see `GITHUB_TOKEN` in your repo’s Settings > Secrets**, it's still available at runtime.

However, if you want to control permissions for this token, go to:

1. **GitHub repo → Settings → Actions → General**
2. Scroll down to **Workflow permissions**
3. Choose one:

    * `Read repository contents` (default)
    * `Read and write permissions` (needed for PR comments, issues, etc.)

---

### 📌 Example usage in workflow:

```yaml
- name: Comment on PR
  uses: actions/github-script@v6
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    script: |
      github.issues.createComment({
        issue_number: context.issue.number,
        owner: context.repo.owner,
        repo: context.repo.repo,
        body: "✅ Tests passed!"
      })
```

Let me know if you want to override `GITHUB_TOKEN` with a **personal access token (PAT)** for more privileges.
