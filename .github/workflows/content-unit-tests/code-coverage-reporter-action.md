Ques:
how does this works -  uses: Flex/code-coverage-reporter-action@v4

is my workflow only using this flex wokflow ?
where is the coverage report being prepared ?
will there be any coverage report table generated in my PR ?

Ans:
Great questions! Let's break down exactly how `uses: Flex/code-coverage-reporter-action@v4` works and how it fits into your GitHub Actions (GHA) workflow.

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **What is `Flex/code-coverage-reporter-action@v4` doing?**

This is a **GitHub Action** that:

* **Takes your code coverage report file** (e.g. generated by JaCoCo, Scoverage, etc.)
* **Parses and summarizes** it
* **Posts a comment directly on your PR** with a code coverage summary (table, diff, etc.)
* Can show coverage increase/decrease compared to the base branch

It **does NOT generate the coverage report** ‚Äî it **only reads/parses/visualizes** it.

---

### ‚ùì 2. **Is my workflow only using this Flex action?**

**No.** The `Flex/code-coverage-reporter-action` is **just one step** in your workflow. Your workflow must also:

1. **Run unit tests**
2. **Generate a coverage report file (like `jacoco.xml`)**
3. Then this Flex action **reads that file** and posts it to the PR.

So the Flex action **depends on the earlier steps** doing their job correctly.

### üß™ 3. **Where is the coverage report being prepared?**

The **coverage report is generated by the tool your build uses**.

For example, if you're using Maven with JaCoCo, your workflow must include:

```yaml
- name: Run tests with JaCoCo
  run: mvn clean test jacoco:report
```

This will generate a file at:

```bash
target/site/jacoco/jacoco.xml
```

Then in your Flex reporter step:

```yaml
ccr_path: target/site/jacoco
ccr_file: jacoco.xml
coverage_reporter: jacoco
```

### üìä 4. **Will a coverage report table be shown in the PR?**

‚úÖ **Yes, if:**

* You generate the coverage file properly.
* You configure `ccr_path`, `ccr_file`, `coverage_reporter` correctly.
* Your workflow runs on PR (`on: pull_request`)
* You give the required `github_token` and optionally your API key.

Then the action **adds a comment on the PR** like:

```
üìä Code Coverage Report
Module: your-service-name

| Coverage Type | Value   |
|---------------|---------|
| Line Coverage | 85.42%  |
| Branch Coverage | 78.90% |
...
```

---

### üß© Summary of What You Need:

1. **Install JaCoCo (or any coverage plugin)**
2. **Run tests + generate coverage**
3. **Pass the path to Flex/code-coverage-reporter-action**
4. ‚úÖ PR comment will be posted

If you want, I can help you set up a complete working Maven + JaCoCo + Flex coverage workflow file. Would you like that?
