When you use:

```yaml
cache: 'maven'
```

inside the `setup-java` step of your GitHub Actions workflow, it **automatically enables caching for Maven dependencies**. This helps **speed up your workflow** by reusing previously downloaded Maven packages (JARs) instead of re-downloading them every time.

---

### üîç What Exactly Happens?

GitHub Actions will:

1. **Create a cache key** based on:

    * The operating system of the runner
    * A hash of your `pom.xml` (because changes in dependencies can be detected here)

2. **Store or restore** the `.m2/repository` directory:

    * This directory is where Maven stores downloaded dependencies.

3. **Re-use the cache** across workflow runs **if the key matches**, which avoids downloading all dependencies again.

| Feature               | What It Helps With                                             |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Faster builds         | No need to download all Maven dependencies again               |
| Reduced network usage | Useful for large projects or repeated PR checks                |
| Reliability           | Less chance of build failures due to missing external packages |
| Cost-efficient        | Saves GitHub Actions minutes on large projects                 |

### üìÅ Equivalent to caching this manually:

If you didn‚Äôt use `cache: 'maven'`, you'd need to add a separate caching step like this:

```yaml
- name: Cache Maven packages
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.m2/repository
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-maven-${{ hashFiles('**/pom.xml') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-maven-
```

But with `cache: 'maven'`, this is **handled automatically** inside the `setup-java` action. Much simpler.

---

### üß† Bonus Tip

If your `pom.xml` changes frequently, you'll want to make sure that `hashFiles('**/pom.xml')` correctly identifies when to update the cache.

Let me know if you want to see a full Java + Maven workflow optimized with caching!
